# Hex-Colors
Just a random linear gradient generator, that displays what the gradient looks like to the user
and the code needed to make it happen that they can just copy off the webpage. Very simple, beginner
project to help learn javascript better.

Problems I Ran Into
Not sure why trying to change div background instead of body, the website didn't work as intended.

Future Updates Incoming
1. Visual Update
2. Add more capability with adding more directions
3. Add more types of random color generating options (i.e color palletes, singular colors, etc)

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, VS Code, Google Chrome Dev Tools
